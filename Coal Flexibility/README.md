## Task Description

We've been asked to prepare analysis for the Thermal Generation Transition team. The team wants to be able to tell the story of whether, and how, Australia's coal fleet has become more flexible as variable-renewable electricity generation has entered the NEM.

We need longitudinal data that meet the criteria below. I'd suggested from year 2000 to today:

### Task 1
For each coal unit, data that show change over time in the unit's daily generation pattern (e.g. hourly or half-hourly aggregates â€” we expect a flatter generation pattern in the past, becoming a steeper ramp-up-down-up-down cycle today).

### Task 2
Similarly, data that show change over time in the unit's seasonal generation pattern (e.g. monthly aggregates).

### Task 3
Data that show technical changes to coal units over time, which might allow them to operate more flexibly (e.g. upgrades/changes to minimum stable loads or ramp rates).

### Task 4
Data that show the amount of variable-renewable energy generation in the NEM. This is purely to allow us to measure the association between VRE and coal unit flexibility.

### For ALL Tasks
See if there is any correlation with coal plant closures, not just flexible behaviour.
